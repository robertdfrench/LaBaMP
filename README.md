LaBaMP
======

Laid Back Message Passing.

Have you got your mind on your money, or your money on your mind? Either way, you haven't got time to fool around with MPI, CUDA, and OpenMP directly. Who needs to spend ages writing fast code when you can just write slower code quicker?

LaBaMP is a Ruby DSL that generates C programs. These programs are not guaranteed or even intended to compile. The ones that do compile may not behave in a way that resembles the LaBaMP code you've written. Or they might. That is up to you. And LaBaMP. Which is not dependable. It's anybody's guess, really. Don't compile code that LaBaMP generates.
